        H3110 Eve, 1st i apologize if i sounded rude or annoying on the phone , i was a bit frustrated at the situation
        as it was the 2nd time of it happening and i'd rather not call about the same thing in such a short time frame .
        Thanks again for your help and patiences with me . At this point i would like to shoot my shot and say hey , 
        you can email me at selvon816 at gmail as i dont have any socials ... 
         you sounded like a really cool human id like to know so i figured why not. 
         If you came here,read THIS and made it this far , say hi.<br></br><br></br>

         i know very unorthodox , but im the type to try ,it never hurts :). <br></br>

      </p>
    </div>
